There are many restaurants of different categories, like Asian, Indian, Italian, Japanese, etc. As part of this project, I will list and visualize the major areas of Prague that have good Vegan restaurants."

    "- Also Prague 6, as it is a big district with a very low number of restaurants of this kind.\n",
    "- If you are a vegan, Prague 4 is the best place to establish a residence or to explore vegan restaurants."
